# THE DOG AND THE BONE

Once a stray dog got a bone with some meat on it from butcher's shop. 

So he lifted the bone and ran to a safe place which is next to a river. After a while, he became thirsy. He took the bone along, as he is afraid some other dogs might take it away. He reached to the river, by chance, he saw his reflechion in the water. He does not know it was his shadow. Rather, he thought it was another dag with a bone in his mouth. He wanted that bone too. So he barked at the other dog, hoping to scare him into giving up the bone. 

You might know what happened afterwards. The bone that he held in his mouth fell into the river.

## ***This Dog***
>Every morning this dog, very attached to me,

>Quietly keeps sitting near my seat

>Till touching its head

>I recognize its company.

>This recognition gives it so much joy

>Pure delight ripples through its entire body.

>Among all dumb creatures

>It is the only living being

>That has seen the whole man

>Beyond what is good or bad in him

>It has seen

>For his love it can sacrifice its life

>It can love him too for the sake of love alone

>For it is he who shows the way

>To the vast world pulsating with life.

>When I see its deep devotion

>The offer of its whole being

>I fail to understand

>By its sheer instinct

>What truth it has discovered in man.

>By its silent anxious piteous looks

>It cannot communicate what it understands

>But it has succeeded in conveying to me

>Among the whole creation

>What is the true status of man.
