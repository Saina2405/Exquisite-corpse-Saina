Once a stray dog got a bone with some meat on it from butcher's shop. 

So he lifted the bone and ran to a safe place which is next to a river. After a while, he became thirsy. He took the bone along, as he is afraid some other dogs might take it away. He reached to the river, by chance, he saw his reflechion in the water. He does not know it was his shadow. Rather, he thought it was another dag with a bone in his mouth. He wanted that bone too. So he barked at the other dog, hoping to scare him into giving up the bone. 

You might know what happened afterwards. The bone that he held in his mouth fell into the river.
